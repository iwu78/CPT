## Overview
Our project idea came from last trimester's joke button page. We found many button CSS designs and modified them to create our own. As a result, we thought that a great idea for our CPT project would be to create a website where users can save and edit designs, with the aim being an online button editor that simplifies complicated parts of CSS such as animations and box shadows. Our website would also have a like/dislike system that collects user data and displays the best designs for users to see. Users would have the option of making designs public and private and sharing designs with others.
