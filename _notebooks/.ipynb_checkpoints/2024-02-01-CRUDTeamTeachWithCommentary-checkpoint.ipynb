    "\n",
    "C-reate: Involves the creation of addition of data to a database. In essence, it \"create\"s entries in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-ead: Involves the retrieval, querying, or \"read\"ing of existing data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "U-pdate: Involves the modification or \"update\"ing of existing data in a database. Operation of changing the values of specific fields in a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "D-elete: Involves the removal or \"delete\"ion of existing data from a database. It's the operation of eliminating information from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, each function has had its own link to fetch from, but with CRUD all four functions will be under one link, differentiated by the request type most suited for it.\n",
    "Create: POST request, as create operation needs to sent data back to the backend, best suited by post request\n",
    "Read: GET request, as read operation is simple and requires no data to be sent back\n",
    "Update: PUT request, as update requires the user ID of the user being updated, and this can be modified in the URL which PUT requests allow\n",
    "Delete: DELETE request, self explanatory\n",
    "This is simpler and makes fetching less confusing, as everything is done under one link. "
